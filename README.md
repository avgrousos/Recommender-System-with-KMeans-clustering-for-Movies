# Recommender-System-with-KMeans-clustering-for-Movies
Anna Rousos.
I trained a KMeans model  recommend movies to people based on how they and other's rated different movies.
With hyperparameters: init = 'random', random_state = 5, n_clusters = 2.
The file named Copy_of_End_of_Week_Assessment containes the code for this project.
The file named movie_ratings - movie_ratings contains the data used for this project.
